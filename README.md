Welcome to our Flower Shop website project, a state-of-the-art, fully responsive e-commerce platform built with Next.js 12. This innovative version of Next.js provides exciting features such as middleware, a Rust compiler, and React 18's concurrent features that enhance performance and developer experience.

Our project leverages the power of Cloudinary for efficient and dynamic media management. It allows us to upload, store, manipulate, and deliver images optimally, ensuring high-quality visual content and a seamless user experience. We manage product images and other media assets effortlessly, creating a visually appealing platform to showcase our floral products.

# Built With

Built an application using Next.js and React, leveraging the latest version, Next.js 12. Implemented CSS styling using twin.macro, which enabled the use of both Tailwind CSS and styled-components.

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

`npm run dev or yarn dev`

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/\*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# What I have considered

## **Server Side Rendering**

## **Twin.macro**

Feeling a bit uncomfortable with implementing code solely using Tailwind CSS, I used a CSS library called Twin.macro, which allows combining Tailwind with Styled Components. Using Twin.macro made it more convenient and easier to style components. After setting the overall structure with Tailwind, I implemented the detailed elements using Styled Components.
